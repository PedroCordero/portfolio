### Interactive Graph Search Visualizer

Developed a fully interactive labyrinth based GUI application in Python to demonstrate and compare classic graph search algorithms. The application simulates a game environment where a virtual cat must navigate mazes under different goals and constraints using search strategies like DFS, BFS, A*, and heuristic guided methods.

#### Key Features  

- *Multiple Algorithms Implemented:* Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Lookahead (greedy), and A* with various heuristics.
- *Interactive GUI:* Built with PySimpleGUI, users can load maps, visualize search expansion, and observe pathfinding decisions in real-time.
- *Custom Problem Settings:* Includes two main problem scenarios â€“ reaching a goal (door) and collecting all items (donuts) before exiting.

### Results:

- Enabled real-time evaluation of algorithm efficiency across different maze complexities and goal structures.
- Improved understanding of heuristic behavior and algorithm performance trade-offs through direct user interaction.
- Successfully showcased the value of interactive learning tools in algorithm education and AI search problems.
