### Obi: Mobile Robot for Emotional Learning in Individuals with ASD

This research presents the design and evaluation of a robotic assistant aimed at improving emotional learning in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The robot was developed to simulate human-like emotions through facial expressions, colors, sounds, and movement, assisting in therapeutic interventions.

#### Key Features

- *Emotion Simulation System*: Uses a facial screen capable of displaying six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), along with a neutral state.
- *Multimodal Expression*: Emotions are conveyed through visual (LED-based facial expressions), auditory (predefined sounds), and motion (body gestures) cues.
- *3D Printed Mobile Structure*: The robot features a compact design with arms, a wheeled base, and a customizable 3D-printed body.
- *Expert Validation Process*: Evaluated by five ASD specialists and 36 practitioners working with ASD individuals.

## Evaluation and Results

- *Appearance Evaluation*: Experts showed substantial agreement on the robot's design suitability (Îº = 0.61).
- *Emotion Recognition Agreement*: Only slight agreement (Îº = 0.14) on the effectiveness of the robotâ€™s emotion display.
- *Therapeutic Usability Feedback*: 78% of practitioners found the robot useful for emotional learning exercises.
- *Future Refinements Identified*: Further improvements needed in emotion expressiveness before direct trials with ASD individuals.
- *Replicable Evaluation Framework*: Provides a structured method for validating assistive robotics before deployment in therapy settings.
