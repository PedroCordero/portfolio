# Artificial Intelligence Portfolio  

Welcome to my AI Portfolio! This portfolio highlights my expertise, projects, and experience in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Automation. As a Master's student specializing in AI with a solid foundation in Electronics Engineering, I have worked on intelligent systems, machine learning, and advanced automation. With over three years of experience as a Scientific Research Engineer and an intern at a multinational automotive company, I am passionate about developing innovative AI-powered solutions and software applications for dynamic and evolving industries.  

## Education
- M.S., Computer Science | Eötvös Loránd University (_July 2025_)
- B.S., Electronics | Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (_Jan 2022_)
- H.S., Mechatronics | Unidad Educativa Técnico Salesiano (_July 2016_)

## Work Experience
**MSc Student Research Intern @ Eötvös Loránd University (_June 2024 - Jan 2025_)**
- Designed and implemented an LLM-driven NLP system for robotics, integrating Meta-Llama-3.1-70B instruct and phi3-14b-medium-128k instruct, ensuring scalable and robust task execution in autonomous frameworks.
- Developed and optimized multi-mobile robot path planning algorithms, utilizing safe-interval trajectory planning with a three-stage approach: pre-processing, RRT* for path generation, and post-processing with Bacterial Mutation and Node Deletion, improving navigation efficiency.
- Trained and fine-tuned a YOLO11 object detection model on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, achieving 90\% average confidence per target with fast convergence and real-time inference capabilities.

**Scientific Research Engineer @ Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (_Feb 2022 - Jan 2023_)**
- Developed robotic assistants for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) therapy, creating platforms that improve social skills, and conducted a two-stage evaluation, achieving Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (ω=0.709) and Cronbach's Alpha (α = 0.94) for design and usability refinement.

**Electronic Engineering Intern @ Continental Tire Andina S.A. (_Feb 2021 - Apr 2021_)**
- Diagnosed and repaired SIEMENS SINAMICS speed controllers, integrated new industrial machines into VersionDog, and developed safety systems using Flexi Soft Designer.
- Developed and implemented a test bench, upgrading tire testing systems with advanced laser sensors to improve measurement accuracy and quality assessment.
