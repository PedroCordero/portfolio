### Results: KPI

| KPI | Description | Formula | Target | Actual | Comments |
|-----|-------------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Project Progress | Monitor the completion rate of tasks assigned to team members to ensure progress according to the project timeline | pp+=1 for every task finished before the deadline | 5 | 19 | Calculated based on the work breakdown structure. Each task weighted one point.|
| Sessions participation | Ensure regular attendance and active participation in team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps | sp=20*n n = number of people present / number of members in the team | 20 | 88.9 | 9 meetings in total without the coach. 6 of them all members participated, in 1 only 4 and in 2 3 people. (6*5 + 1*4 + 2*3) / 9 is average # of people in the meetings. |
| Creativity and Innovation | Encourage the exploration and implementation of innovative features or ideas within the project to enhance its functionality or appeal | ci+=1*n n=number of proposed ideas that we judge as creative/amount of extra effort performed | 5 | 2 | The project has a very good social impact but lacks innovative ideas. |
| Team Satisfaction and Collaboration | Collect feedback from team members regarding their satisfaction with the project, team dynamics, and overall collaboration experience | tsc=sum(f)/5 f=feedback (1 to 5) of each team member about their satisfaction with the project | 5 | 5 | Feedback was collected from each team member. |
