### LLM-based Task Planning for Mobile Robots Using a Novel SLAM Method for Materials Distribution

This work introduces an integrated autonomous mobile robot system for real-time material distribution in factory environments. By combining natural language processing for task interpretation, top-view color-based object detection for map creation, and the IRRT*-RRMS algorithm for path planning, the system enables flexible and scalable operation without relying on traditional navigation methods.

#### Key Features  

- *Collision-Free Navigation:* Ensures safe multi-robot movement using the RoW Rule.
- *Top-View Mapping:* Uses fisheye images and color-based object detection to create occupancy maps for navigation.
- *Natural Language Processing:* Integrates NLP and LLMs to interpret user commands and assembly instructions.
- *Novel SLAM Mapping:* Generates fester maps without conventional SLAM techniques.
- *Advanced Path Planning:* Utilizes IRRT*-RRMS for efficient and adaptive motion control in real environments.

```pseudo
Partial Prompt of LLM1
1: <instruction>
2:   You are a material handling assistant. Your task is to accept user requests for items and send them to the next component.
3: </instruction>
4: <stations>
5:   {{#context#}}
6: </stations>
7: <instructions>
8:    Step 1: If <stations/> is empty:
9:        Sorry, no station information is available. Please try later.
10:   Step 2: When the user inputs items, check if they exist in the station list. The main station cannot be requested.
11:     - If all items exist:
12:       Okay, the items you need are {list of existing items}. Do you need any more items?
13:     - If some items do not exist:
14:       Sorry, {list of non-existing items} do not exist. The items you need are {list of existing items}. Do you need any more items?
15:   Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until the user does not want more items.
16:     - If no more items are needed:
17:       Okay, the final items you need are {final item list}.
18: </instructions>
```

### Results

Tested on a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi with OpenManipulator-X, the system successfully executed material distribution for complex assembly scenarios (e.g., bolts, nuts, and screws in model H), demonstrating reliable performance and adaptability in dynamic industrial settings.
